# Wrapping up Io

## Core Strenghts
As any other prototype language Io is quite malleable, so much that you can create the syntax you want.
The performance, at least in a single threaded enviroment are not that good.

It has a very small footprint, so it is used in embedded systems too.

The concurrency construct are all present and actor, futures and co routines make it much easier to build multithreaded app.

## Weakness

The commuunity is very small, so you will find almost no data online.
And the language without all the syntactic sugar ruby has is a bit harder to absorb concepts that could be easier with sugar.
