## Core Concepts

#### Knowledge Base: 
The foundation of Prolog programming, consisting of facts and rules about the domain of interest.
#### Queries: 
Prolog programs answer queries by attempting to match them against the knowledge base, either affirming or negating assertions, or filling in variables to make statements true.
#### Unification: 
The process by which Prolog attempts to match terms, involving variable bindings to satisfy goals or rules.

## Applications

Prolog shines in domains requiring complex logic and inference, such as:

#### Natural-Language Processing: 
Parsing and understanding human language through rules and inferences.
#### Games AI: 
Modeling behaviors and strategies of virtual opponents.
#### Semantic Web: 
Enhancing web data with semantic information for improved search and automation.
#### Artificial Intelligence: 
Implementing reasoning systems and decision-making agents.
#### Scheduling: 
Optimizing resource allocations within constrained environments.

## Strengths

#### Flexibility: 
Capable of solving a wide range of problems, from simple queries to complex inferences.
#### Expressiveness: 
Allows for concise representation of logical relationships and rules.

## Weaknesses

#### Scalability: 
Handling very large datasets can be computationally intensive due to depth-first search.
#### Specialization: 
While powerful within its niche, Prolog is not suited as a general-purpose language.
#### Learning Curve: 
Requires a deep understanding of its logic programming model to effectively utilize and optimize.
