# Wrapping up Ruby

## Core Strenghts
Duck typing (if it swims like a duck, floats like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck) with Ruby modules and open classes allows us to attach behavior to syntax that goes beyond the typical method or instance variable definition in a class.

Ruby is an ideal scripting language, even though the ecosystem around it is somewhat stagnant (perhaps Python would be a better choice). Despite the language being incredibly productive, keep in mind that it is difficult to compile, and the performance may suffer.

## Scripting
By using existing gems and some straightforward, efficient code, we can integrate two applications together, write a web scraper, or parse CSV/XML files.

## Web development  
Ruby on Rails is highly productive and enables a significantly reduced time-to-market.

## Weakness
- Performance is not what the program language is optimized for, instead it is the dev experience
- Concurrency in OOP has a critical limitation given that the state is wrapped by modifiable obj
- No IDE
