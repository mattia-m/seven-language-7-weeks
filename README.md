# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks Exercises

Welcome to the repository for exercises from the book "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks"! This repository contains my solutions and notes as I work through the book, exploring the following seven programming languages:

1. **Ruby**
2. **Io**
3. **Prolog**
4. **Scala**
5. **Erlang**
6. **Clojure**
7. **Haskell**

Each language has its own directory where you can find the exercises and my implementations.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my learning journey through these diverse programming languages. It serves as a personal reference and might be useful for others reading the book and looking for examples of solved exercises.

## Structure

- `/ruby` - Exercises and notes for Ruby.
- `/Io` - Exercises and notes for Io.
- `/Prolog` - Exercises and notes for Prolog.
- `/Scala` - Exercises and notes for Scala.
- `/Erlang` - Exercises and notes for Erlang.
- `/Clojure` - Exercises and notes for Clojure.
- `/Haskell` - Exercises and notes for Haskell.

## Contributing

While this is a personal project, I'm open to contributions and discussions regarding the exercises and solutions presented here. Feel free to open an issue or pull request if you have suggestions, corrections, or questions.

## Acknowledgments

- Thanks to Bruce A. Tate for writing "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks," which inspired this repository.
- Thanks to all contributors and community members who discuss and improve these languages.

Happy Coding!
