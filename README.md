# Seven Languages in Seven Weeks Exercises

This repository contains my solution for the exercises from the book "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks"! 

1. **Ruby**
2. **Io**
3. **Prolog**
4. **Scala**
5. **Erlang**
6. **Clojure**
7. **Haskell**

Each language has its own directory.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to document my learning journey through these diverse programming languages. It serves as a personal reference and might be useful for others reading the book and looking for examples of solved exercises.

## Structure
